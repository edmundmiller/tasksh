## Implementation Notes üìù

### Auto-Completion System
- **Real-time suggestions**: Updates as user types with intelligent context parsing
- **Multi-type completion**: Supports attributes, projects, tags, priorities, status values, and dates
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys to navigate, Tab to complete, ESC to cancel
- **Visual feedback**: Color-coded suggestions by type with descriptions
- **Integration**: Uses existing taskwarrior data (_projects, _tags commands)
- **Smart parsing**: Understands context like "project:", "+tag", "-tag", attribute:value patterns

### Calendar Component
- Built with Bubble Tea framework for consistency
- Uses standard time.Time for date handling
- Supports both keyboard and visual navigation
- Integrates seamlessly with existing text input fallback

### Edit Functionality  
- Uses tea.ExecProcess() to suspend the Bubble Tea program
- Allows external editor ($EDITOR) to take full terminal control
- Automatically marks tasks as reviewed after successful edit
- Handles editor failures gracefully

### Text Input Fixes
- Fixed by ensuring textInput.Update() is called in all input modes
- Properly returns updated model and commands
- Maintains focus state correctly across mode transitions
- Added modeJustChanged flag to prevent triggering keys from appearing in input

## Contributing ü§ù
