# Time Estimation System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The tasksh planning system now features a sophisticated multi-source time estimation system that provides accurate time estimates based on multiple data sources.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Fixed Unrealistic Estimates**
- "Brush teeth" now correctly estimated at 6 minutes (0.1 hours), not 2.9 hours
- Keyword-based estimation with realistic time buckets:
  - Very quick (6 min): personal care, quick breaks
  - Quick (15 min): emails, quick calls, check-ins
  - Short (30 min): reviews, small tasks, workouts
  - Medium (1.5h): feature implementation, meetings
  - Long (2.5h): research, architecture, planning

### 2. **Priority vs Duration Separation**
- Fixed conceptual error: task priority (H/M/L) no longer affects duration estimates
- High priority tasks can be quick (e.g., "Take heart medication")
- Low priority tasks can be long (e.g., "Research new frameworks")
- Priority = urgency/importance, NOT time required

### 3. **Multi-Source Estimation**
The system now combines estimates from multiple sources in priority order:

1. **Timewarrior Data** (highest confidence)
   - Actual tracked time for completed tasks
   - Partial time with completion percentage for in-progress tasks

2. **Historical Database** (medium confidence)
   - Enhanced similarity matching using Jaccard coefficient
   - Considers keywords, project, and task description
   - Time-weighted to prefer recent completions

3. **AI Estimation** (optional, medium confidence)
   - Uses OpenAI API for intelligent analysis
   - Cached to reduce API calls
   - Enable with `TASKSH_AI_ESTIMATION=true`

4. **Keyword-Based Fallback** (lowest confidence)
   - Realistic time buckets based on task type
   - Description length as last resort

### 4. **Timewarrior Integration**
- **Automatic background sync** - no need to remember to sync!
- Syncs every 4 hours when using planning features
- First sync happens automatically on first estimation
- Manual sync still available if needed:
```bash
# Manual sync commands (optional)
tasksh sync          # Last 30 days (default)
tasksh sync week     # Last 7 days
tasksh sync month    # Last 30 days
tasksh sync year     # Last 365 days
tasksh sync all      # All time data
tasksh sync 2024-01-01  # Since specific date
```

### 5. **Technical Implementation**
- Custom time parser for timewarrior's ISO 8601 basic format
- Database schema updated to support multiple entries per task
- Confidence scoring and learning system for continuous improvement
- 10% buffer added to estimates for planning safety

## Usage Example
When planning, tasks now show accurate estimates with confidence levels:
```
ðŸ“‹ Select tasks for today

AVAILABLE TASKS:
[ ]  â–¶  1. Fix parser bug in config module (3.5h, Critical)
         High priority â€¢ Based on 5 similar tasks (85% confidence)
[âœ“]     2. Review pull request #123 (0.5h, Important)  
         Medium priority â€¢ Based on "review pr" keyword (50% confidence)
[ ]     3. Brush teeth (0.1h, Flexible)
         Low priority â€¢ Very quick personal task (70% confidence)
```

## Best Practices
1. Use timewarrior to track actual time for better future estimates
2. Sync regularly with `tasksh sync week`
3. Use descriptive task names for better keyword matching
4. Review estimation accuracy periodically

The system now provides realistic, data-driven time estimates that help prevent overcommitment and enable better daily planning.
